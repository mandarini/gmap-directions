# Google Maps Platform Directions Service Demo

API link: [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/directions](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/directions)

## Instructions

### Get an API key from Google

First of all, to use this, you need a Google Maps API key. You can generate one here: [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).

### Add API key to map

Search for `YOUR_API_KEY` in the code, and replace it with the API key you generated from the link above.

### Running the app

I'm using `gulp`. So:

First

```
npm install
```

then

```
gulp build-serve
```

and

```
gulp watch
```
